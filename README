through them using a GTK GUI but also from python command line.

DEPENDENCIES

 - pygtk
 - gobject

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

The glade file must be edited with a version up to 3.8 since they support
gtk2 with which is programmed this application.

Pipeline dumps
● Dump pipelines as graphviz graphs
● Use dot to render them
● Run apps with:
GST_DEBUG_DUMP_DOT_DIR=$PWD ./myapp

Logging
● Powerful logging subsystem
● Level, categories, ...
● Run apps with:
GST_DEBUG="*:2,GST_CAPS:4" ./myapp

V4L2Loopback
------------

In order to test is possible to use v4l2loopback that creates
for you some fake video devices with stream of your choice.

The project is hosted at

 # apt-get install v4l2loopback-dkms v4l2loopback-utils
