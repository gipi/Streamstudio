We would like to manage multiple video sources and switch
through them using a GTK GUI but also from python command line.

Quick start:

  $ git clone https://github.com/gipi/Streamstudio.git
  $ cd Streamstudio
  $ python streamstudio.py /dev/video0


DEPENDENCIES
------------

In order to make this program runs you need

 - Gtk3
 - GObject
 - Glade
 - Gstreamer1.0

This program use the PyGOBject introspection <https://live.gnome.org/PyGObject>
in order to be able to use directly the C APIs.

In some distributions there isn't available yet gstreamer1.0, if you want
to use this application, you can use the gstreamer-repo available to the
github repository present at the address

    https://github.com/gipi/gstreamer-repo.git


TESTS
-----

There are also some tests, run them with

 $ python -m unittest tests


DEBUGGING GSTREAMER PART
------------------------

It's possible to debug internal pipelines using the

  GST_DEBUG_DUMP_DOT_DIR=$PWD
  GST_DEBUG="*:2,GST_CAPS:4"

environmental variables.


V4L2Loopback
------------

In order to test is possible to use v4l2loopback that creates
for you some fake video devices with stream of your choice.

The project is hosted at

  https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback/wiki


 # apt-get install v4l2loopback-dkms v4l2loopback-utils
